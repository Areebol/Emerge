However , HD takes up more bandwidth then SD - so the stations can choose between 2 or 3 HD stations , or like 7 or 8 SD stations ( or a mix of both ) They can do a bunch of SD stations and make more money in advertizing by running 7 or 8 different reruns of old SD TV shows at a time In fact , those stations often got permanent rights to show an unlimited number of reruns of old syndicated shows in perpetuity. That means they do n't even have to pay anyone to air old eppisodes of _ Star Trek _ or _ Alf _ So basically it 's free money for them , based on being around for a long , long time and having their old rights get upgraded as new technology comes out.\",\n",

       " 'Question:magic the gathering What is it. how popular is it. who plays it. The culture behind it.. etc. etc I have been hearing more and more about it , and after last nights South Park episode I became curious what it is.. Please explain like I\\'m five.Human_answers:EDIT , Nov 21 : By popular demand , now includes Midrange decks and Limited formats. Also , a new section on where players get their cards. Magic : The Gathering is a collectable card game. It can be played in several different formats , but in the most common , two players create decks out of the cards they own and play against each other. Generally , the cards in a deck are either lands or spells. Lands provide the energy needed to cast spells , and spells usually do one of the following : - Summon a creature that can fight for you or an artifact that you can use. ( * * Creatures * * and * * Artifacts * * ) - Create a lasting effect that affects the game as a whole or one or more cards in play. ( * * Enchantments * * ) - Create an instantaneous effect that affects one or more cards in play or an effect that lasts a single turn. ( * * Sorceries * * and * * Instants * * ) - Summon a sort of \" teammate \" that has its own abilities. ( * * Planeswalkers * * ) The primary goal is to run your opponent out of life points by attacking him with creatures or damaging him directly with spells. There are other ways to win , such as running your opponent out of cards in his deck. The gameplay is complex. The players take turns , but many types of spells can be cast on an opponent \\'s turn , or in response to a spell that they are trying to cast. A critical play by one player may be countered by the other , and that counter itself countered by the first. There are many thousands of cards out there , and you are not expected to know about them all. The Comprehensive Rules ( * not * including the text of cards ) are nearly two hundred pages , although a lot of that consists of old mechanics that are rarely used or highly - specified details that are rarely relevant. The learning curve is pretty steep , but a few games suffice to learn the basic rules. The complexity is more similar to Dungeons and Dragons than to most card games. A key feature of M : tG is the concept of * * color * *. There are five colors : Red , Green , White , Blue , Black. Each is \" allied \" to two others and \" opposed \" to the two others. Most spells require mana of a certain color to cast , which is produced by different types of land cards. Each color has distinct strengths and weaknesses – for example , blue has the best counterspells , but it \\'s not very good at simply hitting things. A given deck will usually use from one to three colors of card , although in some situations decks with four or five colors can work. In addition , it is often considered that there are three general archetypes of deck ( with a * lot * of variation within each category ) : - * * Aggro * * decks focus on dealing damage ASAP to win ASAP. They usually have cheap creatures ( \" weenies \" ) that can be used right away and \" buff\"-type spells to eke out a few more points of damage. They usually win fast or not at all , because they often ca n\\'t stand up to the more powerful creatures and spells that are played later in the game. - * * Control * * decks focus on preventing the opponent from acting until the player is ready to win with powerful spells or abilities. They run a lot of counterspells , destruction spells , and things that make action more expensive for the opponent , along with a few creatures strong on defense and disruption. They usually win by using cheap defenses against expensive attacks until they are ready to overwhelm the opponent with their accumulated strength , and lose if they just ca n\\'t stay ahead of the enemy \\'s attacks. - * * Combo * * decks rely on a few combinations of cards that can lead to a near - instant victory. There * are * infinite combos in M : tG , but they \\'re designed to be difficult or resource - intensive to pull off. A combo deck will usually run ( in addition to the all - important combo pieces ) \" tutor \" cards that let them search their deck , protection cards to guard the combo pieces , and just enough stall cards to prevent a quick defeat. A combo deck wins when it gets its combo in place before losing , and loses if it ca n\\'t get the combo out in time or ca n\\'t protect it long enough to use it. - * * Midrange * * decks are a common intermediate archetype between Aggro and Control. Midrange tries to beat down the opponent with damage from powerful creatures ( colloquially , \" fatties \" ) rather than with cheap ones ( \" weenies \" ). These decks have to run enough control to stay alive until the big hitters come out. They win when they get the hitters out early enough to do lethal damage , and lose when they ca n\\'t get the big guys out at all ( being out - controlled ) or when they just take too much of a beating too early ( being out - aggro\\'d ). --- Many different kinds of people play M : tG. There are professional players who win large sums at tournaments , groups of friends who play casually on the weekends , and everything in between. If you \\'re playing competitively , it can be absurdly expensive , as you can not compromise on getting the perfect cards for your deck , but if you and your opponents are playing casually , it \\'s a lot cheaper. The most common formats are as follows. Two - player games are the norm for tournaments , but casual matches are often multiplayer. * * Constructed * * formats call for pre - constructed decks built from each player \\'s personal collection : - * * Standard * * : Decks are made of cards printed in about the last 18 months. - * * Modern * * : Decks are made of cards printed since about 2003 ( minus a ban list ). - * * Legacy * * : Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a ban list ). - * * Vintage * * : Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a * very small * ban list ). - * * Commander * * ( or \" EDH \" ): Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a ban list ) , but limited to one of each card. One creature card is designated as your \" commander \" and is nearly always available for summoning. A popular multiplayer format. * * Limited * * formats feature decks made on the spot from a limited pool of cards : - * * Sealed * * : Each player opens several randomized booster packs and makes a deck from the contents. - * * Draft * * : A group of players open many packs and use a system to pick their cards from the contents , then build a deck from what they have. These formats cost money each time to play , because you need to buy booster packs. However , you can play them without having any of your own cards beforehand. Limited play can be a good way to pick up more cards. A relatively new casual format is * * Cube * * , in which you and your group put together a large pile of cards beforehand and use them in place of booster packs. This eliminates the recurring expense , although you need to have enough cards beforehand. There are others formats , including Conspiracy , Planechase , Pauper ( use no rare cards ). Two - Headed Giant ( play with a partner ) , and many more. Formats that allow older cards tend to be more expensive , because the cards have been out of print for a long time. Commander is a bit cheaper than other formats that allow old cards , because you only can have one of each card ( other formats usually allow up to four of each card ). I play Commander with my D & D group. None of us puts that much money into it , and we try to keep it more fun than competitive. Some of the players also play in local mini - tournaments on Friday nights ( \" Friday Night Magic \" ) , usually breaking about even. --- So , where does one get cards?Most cards come from randomized booster packs with 15 cards each. Cards from a given set are designated either common , uncommon , rare , or \" mythic rare \". You can buy booster packs for around $ 3.50 USD from retailers , or you can buy them as part of a limited tournament. There are also pre - made decks that you can buy directly from Wizards of the Coast. Each one has a theme and cards intended to work together. You wo n\\'t win any tournaments with a pre - made deck , but it can be a good starting point. In addition , there are a couple of products intended for beginners , such as the \" Deck - builder \\'s toolkit \" with a semi - randomized selection of cards and a big stack of common lands. ( Common lands are dirt cheap , but it would take quite a few booster packs to get enough to build a deck. ) Most M : tG players trade cards with their friends or at events to get the specific cards they need. In addition , there is a thriving market of single cards at game stores and online. Some very , very old cards are very , very rare and expensive. A single [ Black Lotus ] ( URL_0 ) can cost many thousands of dollars. But these cards are not legal in most formats , and most players will never have seen one in person. When playing casually , your group may allow the use of \" proxy \" cards to substitute for the pricey ones. Myself , I \\'ve only been playing for a year or so , and I do n\\'t actually own my own cards ! ( My friends have a ton of extra decks to lend out. ) I \\'m planning to build my own Commander deck soon , and I \\'ll be starting from a pre - made deck from Wizards and supplementing it primarily with trades with friends and singles from the internet.']"
